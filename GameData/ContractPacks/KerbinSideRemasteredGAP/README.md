# KerbinSideRemasteredGAP
Contract Pack for Air flights to bases in Kerbin Side Remastered mod

Notes:
- Contains flight contracts from KSC to Bases in the Kerbin Side Remastered mod.
     - modeled after flight missions provided in Contract Pack: Giving Aircraft a Purpose (GAP) V1.6.1 but not dependent on this mod
- Contains flightplans for Kramax Autopilot Continued mod
     - Flightplans provide landing information for the various runways at the individual bases
     - Runways where the AoA of the landing sequence proved to be too steep due to terrain were omitted from the flight plans.
     - Complete site to site flightpalns as provided by the original Kerbin Side GAP mod are not included. 

Install:
- place directory KerbinSideRemasteredGAP and all sub directories and files in your Gamedata/ContractPacks directroy (Create if it does not already exist)
