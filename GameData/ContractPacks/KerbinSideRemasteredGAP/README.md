Contract Pack for Air flights to bases in Kerbin Side Remastered mod

## New in version 3.0.0
This release of KerbinSide Remastered GAP marks the expansion of the available airports for missions designed by me. 
- Aracama Airport 
- Osealis Airport
- Foldrenview International Airport
- Foldrenview International Airport 

These airports are created with KK statics from KerbinsSideRemastered and two additional modes that provide KK Statics are now required 
- KerbinSide Core 
- Omega's Stockalike Structures

The introduction of the new airports will reorder contracts currently active. You should complete any outstanding KSRGAP contracts prior to upgrading.
